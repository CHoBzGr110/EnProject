  <h2>Neck Pain While Studying? Your Body's Begging for a Break!</h2>
  <p>Hey, I see you—head down, elbows on the desk, eyes glued to the textbook for hours. You're killing it with the studying, but what about your poor neck and shoulders?</p>

  <p><strong>Let’s fix that with some simple moves that take less than a minute.</strong> Seriously. You don’t need to be a gym rat or do yoga on your chair—just <em>tiny motions = big relief</em>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. The “Look Over There” Stretch</strong><br>
    Slowly turn your head left... then right. Hold for 5 seconds each side. Do it like you’re trying to eavesdrop on drama nearby. Your neck will love it.</li>

    <li><strong>2. Shrug Like You Don’t Care</strong><br>
    Raise your shoulders up to your ears and drop them. Repeat 10 times. Feels silly, feels good.</li>

    <li><strong>3. Back-Behind Stretch</strong><br>
    Interlace your fingers behind your back and stretch your arms downward. Open up that chest like a proud superhero.</li>

    <li><strong>4. Desk Push-Ups</strong><br>
    Put your hands on the desk, take a step back, and do push-ups standing. 5 reps during your break = golden.</li>

    <li><strong>5. Eye Break Magic</strong><br>
    Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Your eyes are muscles too!</li>

    <li><strong>6. Walk & Sip</strong><br>
    Use your water breaks wisely. Stand up, stretch, sip. You just gave your spine a mini holiday.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Your brain needs your body to show up too.</strong> Even the best mind can’t study well in a sore body. A few stretches, a little awareness, and boom—you’re sharper, faster, and more comfortable.</p>
