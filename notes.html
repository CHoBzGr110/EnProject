    <h1>Effective Note Taking for Math Students</h1>

  <p>
    Studying effectively at the undergraduate level begins by learning ideas in a way that focuses on understanding, recall, and critical thinking. Over the years, many note taking techniques have been developed with the goal of maximizing studying efficiency. We are going to discuss the five most used methods: Cornell, Outline, Mapping, Charting, and Sentence.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Cornell Method</h2>
  <p>
    The Cornell Method is built upon separating your pages into three zones:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Notes Column (right):</strong> Record lecture material in real time: definitions, explanations, and examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Cue Column (left):</strong> After class, note down keywords, questions, or uncertainties that correspond to the notes.</li>
    <li><strong>Summary Section (bottom):</strong> Write a concise paragraph that synthesizes the main ideas and what to work on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This format makes the student engage with the material: by formulating the concept and summarizing in your own words, you reinforce memory while creating a review tool simultaneously. It is most effective in courses where understanding the concepts and frequent self-testing is necessary. However, the layout can feel constraining when you need to write long proofs or have multiple examples.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Outline Method</h2>
  <p>
    The Outline Method uses a structure that focuses on headings and subheadings:
  </p>
  <pre>
1. Main Topic  
   1.1. Subtopic or definition  
        Supporting detail or example  
   1.2. Next subtopic  
        Supporting detail or example  
2. Another Main Topic...
  </pre>
  <p>
    This nested approach follows the logical progression of many lectures, mainly in STEM fields where material is built step by step. By visually nesting ideas, we get to immediately see how each detail fits into the broader title. Although, if a lecture isn’t linear and lacks clear organization, we would be forcing an outline that doesn’t fit the style of the material and that could hinder your learning.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Mapping Method</h2>
  <p>
    It’s known as mind-mapping, it is about laying out concepts in a network rather than a list, and that focuses on connections rather than structure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Central node:</strong> The lecture’s main theme.</li>
    <li><strong>Branches:</strong> Major subtopics that go outward, each with its own definitions, properties, or examples.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mapping is excellent at revealing relationships between information. It’s ideal for subjects where connections are key, like linking different proof techniques or seeing how various theories interrelate. However, drawing and expanding a map during a class without knowing what to focus on can be time-consuming, and the format will be cluttered especially if the lecture includes lengthy proofs.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Charting Method</h2>
  <p>
    Charting organizes information in a table of rows and columns. For example, in a history lecture, it’s commonly used to compare rulers by reign, policies, and achievements. In biology, we use it to list species traits across several axes. This grid structure makes side-by-side comparisons easier and clearer. Yet this format doesn’t fit most lectures, which makes it ineffective in a lot of modules, and it can also be tricky to implement on your own.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Sentence Method</h2>
  <p>
    The simplest: write each new point on its own line as a complete sentence. It is direct and adaptable to any lecture style. It ensures you note down every idea. But this linear, unstructured flow makes the logical relationships that matter harder to spot, and that implies that you will have to go back and reorganize when you review.
  </p>

  <h2>Choosing the Right Method for Math</h2>
  <p>
    For someone who's studying mathematics at the undergraduate level, a good note taking method is required — it needs to do more than writing down what the professor says. It should help you understand the ideas and remember the material in the long term. In Math, all the lectures are usually connected and are follow-ups of each other, so perhaps the reason that a definition is not getting through your head is that you’re missing an important part of the sequence of lectures. This means that not all note taking methods are helpful and effective.

  <p>
    We have established that the Outline Method works pretty well as a base, but it should also be adjusted for reviewing notes, so perhaps it’s better paired with the Cornell method:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Use clear headings to keep track of topics, definitions, theorems, and examples. The indentation helps show how the ideas relate and build on each other.</li>
    <li>Highlight formulas and important steps in proofs to make them easier to review later.</li>
    <li>Set aside a margin or a space at the bottom of each page like in the Cornell system where you can write down extra thoughts after the lecture ends. These will be reminders, things to focus on, different ways of solving problems, and the intuition behind a problem.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A good addition would be leaving some space between main sections to make filling in missing information easier. We could also use different colours to keep track of things. For example, one color for definitions, another for theorems, and a third for proofs or examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's also recommended to spend a few minutes revising any steps you found tricky after class to make sure you got the hang of the material. Doing this by hand helps you understand them better and trains your hand for the exam day.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Note taking for a math major isn’t just about writing things down — it’s about making sense of what you’re learning, organizing your work, and being able to come back to it later. Combining the Outline Method with a Cornell-style summary helps you stay organized during class and work through the material afterward. It’s a simple way to keep track of what matters and build a stronger understanding over time.
