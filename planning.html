         <h1>Note-Taking for Undergraduate Mathematics Students</h1>

  <p>
    For someone who's studying mathematics at the undergraduate level, a good note-taking method is required.
    It needs to do more than just writing down what the professor says. It should help you understand the ideas,
    and remember the material in the long term.
  </p>

  <p>
    In math, all the lectures are usually connected and are follow-ups of each other, so perhaps the reason
    that definition is not getting through your head is that you're missing an important part of the sequence
    of lectures. This means that not all note-taking methods are helpful and effective.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have established that the Outline Method works pretty well as a base, but it should also be adjusted
    for reviewing notes, so perhaps it's better paired with the Cornell method:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Use clear headings to keep track of topics, definitions, theorems, and examples. The indentation helps
      show how the ideas relate and build on each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      Highlight formulas and important steps in proofs to make them easier to review later.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set aside a margin or a space at the bottom of each page like in the Cornell system where you can write
      down extra thoughts after the lecture ends. These will be reminders, things to focus on, and different
      ways of solving problems, and to note down the intuition behind a problem.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A good addition would be leaving some space between main sections to make filling in missing information easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    We could also use different colours to keep track of things. For example, we could use one color for definitions,
    another for theorems, and a third for proofs or examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's also recommended to spend a few minutes revising any steps you found tricky after class to make sure you got
    the hang of the material. Doing this by hand helps you understand them better and trains your hand for the exam day.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Note-taking for a math major isn't just about writing things down. It's about making sense of what you're learning,
    organizing your work, and being able to come back to it later. Combining the Outline Method with a Cornell-style
    summary helps you stay organized during class and work through the material afterward. It's a simple way to keep
    track of what matters and build a stronger understanding over time.
